обработчик нажатия для нее, в котором выполняем все необходимые действия\n let btn = new ely.button({text: \"Click me\"});\n btn.click( () => {\n    new ely.server.captcha().run(result => {\n          if(result){\n              // Do smt when all ok\n          }\n    });\n });Данный способ подходит для срочного решения поставленной задачи, он структурирован и понятен сразу.\nВторой способ использует удаленный обработчик и удаленное соединение. Он подойдет для выполнения\nодинаковых (регулярных) процессов после вызова каптчи.\n // Создаем удаленный обработчик каптчи loginTest\n ely.server.captcha.addObserver( \"loginTest\", (result) => {\n    if(result){\n        // Do smt when ok\n        // Например, отображаем страницу\n    }\n });\n\n // Где-то в друго части кода\n let btn = new ely.button({text: \"Button\"});\n btn.click( () => new ely.server.captcha( {name: \"loginTest\"} ).run() );\n            \n\n\n\n\n            \n    Index\n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                        Properties\n
